# **_Description_**

A site that helps vehicle owners keep track of the maintenance needed to keep their transportation going.
Keeping it all in your head, retreiving scattered paper records, or depending on other shops to remember all your info is one way to do it. Another way is to have a database you can access at home and make adjustments as needed.

# Technologies Used:

- FRONT END
  React.Js for client-side interfacing | CSS and Adobe Rush for Styling
- BACK END
  MongoDB and Express for server-side data management

---

# Getting Started:

1. Create the Schemas to be used for back end files, and use MongoDB to build the data structure.
2. Create the Objects to be used to populate the front end, and use React.js and Express to build an easy and intuitive client navigation.
3. Arrange intuitive and approachable page layouts with grid styling, clean text, and detailed photos.
